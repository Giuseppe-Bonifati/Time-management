#### Description 

I use the Pomodoro technique to build a time management tool to break the work in small intervals of 55 minutes.

The Pomodoro Technique is a TIME MANAGEMENT method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length (in this toll we changed for 55 minutes), separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato.

## Installation :package:

##### Mp3 Sound Pygame :sound:

I downloaded the Mp3 from pixabay and then to play it I installed pygame:

```sql
pip install pygame
```
Pygame plays the mp3  sound each time the user should take 5 minutes breaks

##### Import

Then in the file main.py import the following:

```python
import tkinter
import math
import pygame
```

##### Imagine :tomato:

tomato.png is the img used inside the tkinter window



## Design

To Build this tool i use Tkinter with 4 different functions:

### Functions

#### play

Used to play the mp3 sound

```python
pygame.mixer.init()

def play():
    '''function that play the sound on the 1.mp3 file'''
    pygame.mixer.music.load("1.mp3")
    pygame.mixer.music.play(loops=0)
```

#### reset

I use the function to reset the label , the time and the reps (reps is global var used to count the breaks , each 2 times 1 break).

#### start

Each time start will be called , the time of work/break will start to count_down(), the function check when to be on break and how many breaks the user took it.
Everytimes the user haft to take a break, the function play() will play the mp3 sound and the label will change status from "Work" to "Break".


#### count_down

Shows the time of work and when the time get to zero the function will call the function start()
The function count_down will add a marks âœ… each time that will have a break

:bangbang: Important

To get and to show to the user the correct time, we use floor from the math library:

```python
import math
```
Example how to use floor from the math library:

```python
min = math.floor(230 / 60) # result 3 min
sec = math.floor(230 % 60) # result 50 sec
```

So the function count_down() take as arguments count(seconds) and each 1 second we count -1, like this we keep counting down and we display to the user the correct time, once the time get to zero will call the function start()

```python
if count > 0:
        global timer
        timer = window.after(1000, count_down, count -1) 

#Timer is a global variable used also in the function reset() to reset the time
        
```


The function count_down() will interact with the label check mark, and each 2 times that count get to zero, then the start() function will be called and will add a check mark to the label check_marks.
